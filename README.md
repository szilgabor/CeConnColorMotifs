The aim of this tool is to evaluate directed and signed 3-node subgraphs of the Caenorhabditis elegans connectome (and in random networks for comparison).

motifdef.csv : definition of motifs. 
  If we name the nodes ‘A’, ‘B’ and ‘C’, the 6-digit code representes edges in the following order: A->B, B->A, B->C, C->B, C->A, A->C
  Different number correspond to different edge ‘colours’
    ‘1’ is a virtual colour, it means that there is no connection in that direction
    ‘2’ means that the synapse is excitatory
    ‘3’ means that the synapse is inhibitory
    ‘4’ means that the polarity of the synapse is unknown
  The name of the motifs consists a letter and a number
    The letter shows the uncolored structure of the motif
    The number shows the exact coloring of the motif
  Rotational and reflectional symmetries were considered as the same motif
triplets.csv : triplets in the C. elegans connectome
  3 node of the connectome is considered as a triplet, if none of them is isolated from the other two
  Neurons are represented by 3-digit number from 101 to 402
    Therefore triplets are represented by 9-digit numbers (the codes of the 3 neurons combined)
motifnames.csv : names of motifs defined in motifdef.csv
edges.csv : list of signed edges in the connectome and 1 000 random networks
  Neurons are represented as 3-digit numbers (see above), therefore edges are coded as 6-digit numbers (the combination of the pre- and postsynaptic neuron code)
  Edge-colours are coded from 2 to 4 (see above)
